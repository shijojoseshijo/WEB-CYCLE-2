        The Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank
        of the river Yamuna in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India. It was commissioned
        in 1631 by the fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan to house
        the tomb of his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of
        Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare
        (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set
        in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.

        The India Gate (formerly known as All India War Memorial) is a war
        memorial located near the Kartavya path on the eastern edge of the
        "ceremonial axis" of New Delhi, formerly called Rajpath. It stands as a
        memorial to 84,000 soldiers of the Indian Army who died between 1914 and
        1921 in the First World War, in France, Flanders, Mesopotamia, Persia,
        East Africa, Gallipoli and elsewhere in the Near and the Far East, and
        the Third Anglo-Afghan War. 13,300 servicemen's names, including some
        soldiers and officers from the United Kingdom, are inscribed on the
        gate.[2] Designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, the gate evokes the
        architectural style of the ancient Roman triumphal arches such as the
        Arch of Constantine in Rome, and later memorial arches; it is often
        compared to the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, and the Gateway of India in
        Mumbai.

        The Charminar (lit.â€‰'four minarets') is a monument located in Hyderabad,
        Telangana, India. Constructed in 1591, the landmark is a symbol of
        Hyderabad and officially incorporated in the emblem of Telangana.[3] The
        Charminar's long history includes the existence of a mosque on its top
        floor for more than 425 years. While both historically and religiously
        significant, it is also known for its popular and busy local markets
        surrounding the structure, and has become one of the most frequented
        tourist attractions in Hyderabad. Charminar is also a site of numerous
        festival celebrations, such as Eid-ul-adha and Eid al-Fitr,[4] as it is
        adjacent to the city's main mosque, the Makkah Masjid.
